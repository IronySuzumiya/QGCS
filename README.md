# QGCS (Quantum Graph Computing Simulator)

A highly-optimized quantum simulator written in C, aimed at accelerating graph algorithms, planned to be deployed on a FPGA using HLS in the future.

A quantum minimum searching algorithm has been implemented already, based on Grover's algorithm, serving as a component in SSSP.
